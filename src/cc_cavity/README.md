# [CC-CAVITY](#CC-CAVITY)


## Introduction
The `cc_cavity` class is a module of Hilbert which implements the Coupled-Cluster (CC) and 
Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster (EOM-CC) methods with quantum electrodynamics (QED) for the simulation of 
cavity polaritons using the [TiledArray](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarrayhttps://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray) library.

## Features

- Implements QED-CC methods for ground state calculations
  - CCSD and QED-CCSD-1 methods are implemented
  - CCSDT, CCSDTQ, QED-CCSDT-1, and QED-CCSDTQ-1 infrastructures are in place, however, the residual equations are not yet open sourced.


- Provides QED-EOM-CC methods for excited state calculations (optional)
  - EOM-EE-CCSD and QED-EOM-EE-CCSD-1 methods are implemented (excitation energies)
  - EOM-EA-CCSD and QED-EOM-EA-CCSD-1 infrastructures are in place, however, it is still under development.
  - The EOM-CC methods are implemented using the Non-Symmetric Davidson algorithm, which is an interative subspace diagonalization method.
- Builds the 1-RDMs for the excited state methods, which is used to compute the transition dipole moments.
  - Only available for EOM-EE-CCSD and QED-EOM-EE-CCSD-1 methods.
  - 2-RDMs are not yet implemented.

- Utilizes the TiledArray library for efficient tensor operations
  - Supports MPI distributed memory parallelization, however, this is not yet implemented for EOM-CC methods.
- Includes ex

## Directory Structure

- `include`: Contains header files for the `cc_cavity` class
  - `derived`: Contains header files for derived classes
- `src`: Contains the source files for the `cc_cavity` class, including derived classes for QED-CC and QED-EOM-CC methods
    - `derived`: Contains source files for derived classes
- `misc`: Contains miscellaneous helper functions and utilities

## Installation

Follow the same instructions as the README.md file in the root directory of the Hilbert project, 
with the following modifications:

- To enable QED-CC functionality, set the `WITH_TA` flag in CMake to `ON`.
  ``` bash
  cmake {...psi4-generated stuff...} -DWITH_TA=ON -Bobjdir -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_hilbert_top_dir
  ```
- it is also recommended to add `-G Ninja` to the cmake line to speed up the build process. 
  It is also more stable for installing TiledArray, which is a dependency of CC_Cavity.

After completing these steps, the `cc_cavity` class will be available as a plugin in your Psi4 installation. 
You can then use it to perform QED-CC and QED-EOM-CC calculations.

## Dependencies

- TiledArray, and its [dependencies](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray/blob/master/INSTALL.md#prerequisites) (automatically built by CMake if not available)
- Psi4 (which this plugin is built for) and its [dependencies](https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html#faq-coredepend)
- MPI (required even with a single node)
- MPI4PY
  - This is a Python package that is used to interface with the MPI library through Psi4.
  - This package must be installed using the same python interpreter that Psi4 is using.
  - If you are using the Psi4 conda environment, then you can install this package using the following command:
  `conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py`
  - If not using conda, you can check which python interpreter Psi4 uses by running the following command:
    ``` bash
    grep -m 1 pyexe_dir `which psi4` | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
    ```
  - Install the mpi4py package using the same python interpreter:
  `/path/to/python -m pip install mpi4py`

### Usage

After installing the `cc_cavity` plugin, you can use it within Psi4 to perform QED-CC and QED-EOM-CC calculations. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your input file for Psi4, including the molecular geometry, basis set, and other desired options. 
2. Add `import hilbert` to the top of your input file and add the path to your Hilbert installation directory to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or using the `sys` module in your input file.
3. Set the desired method and options for the `cc_cavity` calculation using the `set` command.
4. Run the calculation with `energy('cc_cavity')`.

### Example
Here is an example input file to run with Psi4 that has comments for the different settings that can be included.

``` python
sys.path.insert(0, '../')
import hilbert

If the name of this file is `input.dat`, the file can be run with the following command:
``` bash
psi4 -n $NUM_THREADS input.dat output.dat
```

Where $NUMTHREADS is the number of threads you wish to run the calculation with (when using parallel BLAS).
To run the calculation with mpi, you can use the following command:
``` bash
mpirun -n $NUM_THREADS psi4 input.dat output.dat
```
Note: MPI functionality is not optimized as of now.
